# Crazy Python

These exercises are designed to give you a feel for Python at a deep level.
The intent is to test your understanding of various parts of the language by taking you outside the comfort zone of your intuition.
You will learn how various language features work  by using them somewhat outside of their normal usage.

Each exercise includes a set of instructions, potentially a set of questions, and then  a series of pytest tests.
The goal is to follow the instructions, produce something that passes the tests, and if there are questions, answer them.
