# Descriptor Protocol and Attributes

For these exercises become familiar with the discriptor protocol
(__get__, __set__, __dell__), and methods related to attribute access
(__getattr__, __setattr__, __getattribute__, __delattr__), the item
access protocol (__getitem__, __setitem__, __delitem__).  Understand
the difference between these and __del__.

Also take a look at collections.abc and functools.
